## Using the Weather package

The `/whisk.system/weather` package offers a convenient way to call the Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix API.

The package includes the following action.

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/weather` | package | username, password | Services from the Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix API  |
| `/whisk.system/weather/forecast` | action | latitude, longitude, timePeriod | forecast for specified time period|

Creating a package binding with the `username` and `password` values is suggested. This way, you don't need to specify the credentials every time you invoke the actions in the package.

### Getting a weather forecast for a location

The `/whisk.system/weather/forecast` action returns a weather forecast for a location by calling an API from The Weather Company. The parameters are as follows:

- `username`: Username for The Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix that is entitled to invoke the forecast API.
- `password`: Password for The Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix that is entitled to invoke the forecast API.
- `latitude`: The latitude coordinate of the location.
- `longitude`: The longitude coordinate of the location.
- `timeperiod`: Time period for the forecast. Valid options are '10day' - (default) Returns a daily 10-day forecast , '48hour' - Returns an hourly 2-day forecast, , 'current' - Returns the current weather conditions, 'timeseries' - Returns both the current observations and up to 24 hours of past observations, from the current date and time.


The following is an example of creating a package binding and then getting a 10-day forecast.

1. Create a package binding with your API key.

  ```
  $ wsk package bind /whisk.system/weather myWeather --param username MY_USERNAME --param password MY_PASSWORD
  ```

2. Invoke the `forecast` action in your package binding to get the weather forecast.

  ```
  $ wsk action invoke myWeather/forecast --blocking --result --param latitude 43.7 --param longitude -79.4
  ```

  ```

              ...
          },
          ...
      ],
  }
  ```
